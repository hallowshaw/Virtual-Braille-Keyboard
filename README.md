# Virtual Braille Keyboard in ReactJS


## Overview

A Virtual Braille Keyboard can be a valuable tool for individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Braille is a tactile writing system that uses raised dots to represent letters, numbers, and symbols, allowing blind individuals to read through touch. A virtual Braille keyboard extends this concept to digital devices, providing a software-based interface that emulates the physical Braille display. The Virtual Braille Keyboard in ReactJS is a sophisticated application designed to facilitate Braille input and translation to the English language. This project leverages the power of ReactJS and Vite to deliver a seamless user experience, offering an intuitive virtual keyboard and a robust translation feature.
